# ðŸš€ Key Insights About Crossover in Genetic Algorithms (TSP)
# âœ… 1. Crossover Mixes Good Traits
#
# We select two good parents from the population.
# We assume their city sequences contain good patterns.
# By mixing parts of both, we hope to create a better offspring.
# âœ… 2. Crossover is Randomâ€”It Can Go Wrong
#
# Sometimes, we accidentally combine bad parts instead of good ones.
# In the early generations, many offspring won't be better than their parents.
# Thatâ€™s okay! Not every child needs to be betterâ€”just a few!
# âœ… 3. Why Crossover Works in the Long Run
#
# Many crossovers happen, so some lucky children inherit great routes.
# Selection ensures only the best offspring survive.
# Mutation adds diversity, preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in bad solutions.
# âœ… 4. The Balance Between Exploration & Exploitation
#
# Exploitation = Keeping and refining the best solutions.
# Exploration = Allowing new possibilities (mutation helps here).
# A good GA balances both to find an optimal route over generations.
